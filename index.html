    <h2>your project has potential</h2>
    
    <p>After 10 years, most residential hardwood floors begin showing their age; versus 2 - 3 years for commercial wood floors. Worn finishes, scratches, dullness and discoloration are the most common signs that the wood is due for refinishing. The typical 3/4-inch thick hardwood floor can be sanded 4 - 6 times during its lifetime. So unless you live in a particularly old house, chances are that your wood floors can be restored to a beautiful condition.</p>
