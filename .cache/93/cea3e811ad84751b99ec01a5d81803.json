Worn finishes, scratches, dullness and discoloration are the most common signs that the wood is due for refinishing. The typical 3/4-inch thick hardwood floor can be sanded 4 - 6 times during its lifetime. So unless you live in a particularly old house, chances are that your wood floors can be restored to a beautiful condition.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>contact us for a quote</h2>\r\n    <button class=\"btn\">get a quote</button>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<section class=\"flooring\">\r\n<div class=\"el__container\">\r\n    <h2>ABOUT SEXTON HARDWOOD FLOORING, LLC</h2>\r\n    <p>Brian Sexton offers the highest quality hardwood floor and stair refinishing services in the Greater Chicago Area, Northwest Suburbs & North Shore.
